# Ruby on Rails 5, BDD, Rspec and Capybara | Udemy
This repo is my course project(s) for the udemy course:  
https://www.udemy.com/ruby-rails-5-bdd-rspec-capybara/  

The course itself uses cloud9 IDE, and may not use phantomjs, but here I will be developing using Docker and attempt to follow along, getting everything working using phantomjs inside the container.

:fingers_crossed:
